            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines.
            These machines can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception,
            speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI has applications in various fields
            including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.

            Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience
            without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to identify patterns in data and make
            predictions or decisions. Common types include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and
            reinforcement learning. Popular frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

            Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers
            to model and understand complex patterns. It has revolutionized fields like computer vision,
            natural language processing, and speech recognition. Deep learning models can automatically
            learn hierarchical representations of data, making them powerful for complex tasks.
